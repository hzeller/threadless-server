Experimenting with C++11 closures and Unix select() to make an easy-to-use and

Nothing interesting to see here, just experiments. Real world would use libev
or libevent or something.

threadless-server : a simple echo server, listing on port 3000
fortune-teller    : an even simpler fortune teller server, listening on 3001
